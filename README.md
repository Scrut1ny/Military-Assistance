## Versions of the ASVAB

| Version                        | How You Take It                                                                 | Format                          | Purpose                                                                                                           |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Student                       | Given to juniors and seniors in high school; administered through a cooperative program between the Department of Education and the Department of Defense at high schools across the United States | Paper                           | Its primary purpose is to provide a tool for guidance counselors to use when recommending civilian career areas to high school students (though it can be used for enlistment if taken within two years of enlistment). For example, if a student scores high in electronics, the counselor can recommend electronics career paths. If a student is interested in military service, the counselor then refers them to the local military recruiting offices. |
| Enlistment                    | Given through a military recruiter at a Military Entrance Processing Station (MEPS) or at a satellite testing site | Usually computer, may be paper | This version of the ASVAB is used by all the military branches for the purpose of enlistment qualification and to determine which military jobs a recruit can successfully be trained in. |
| Enlistment Screening Test (EST)| Given at the discretion of a military recruiter for a quick enlistment qualification screening | Computer                        | These mini-ASVABs aren’t qualification tests; they’re strictly recruiting and screening tools. The EST contains about 50 questions similar but not identical to questions on the AFQT portion of the ASVAB. The test is used to help estimate an applicant’s probability of obtaining qualifying ASVAB scores. |
| Pre-screening, internet-delivered Computerized Adaptive Test (PiCAT) | Online, on your own time after receiving an access code from your recruiter | Computer                        | The PiCAT is an unproctored, full version of the ASVAB. You take it on your own time, but you must take a verification test at a MEPS to validate your score. The verification test typically takes 25 to 30 minutes to complete. |
| Armed Forces Classification Test (AFCT) | Given at installation educational centers to people already in the military through the Defense Manpower Data Center | Computer                        | At some point during your military career, you may want to retrain for a different job. If you need higher ASVAB scores to qualify for such retraining, or if you’re a commissioned officer who wants to become a warrant officer, you can take the AFCT. The AFCT is essentially the same as the other versions of the ASVAB. |

### 17C (Cyber Operations Specialist) MOS Example:

| Requirement | Minimum Score | Formula Used                          |
|-------------|---------------|---------------------------------------|
| GT Score    | 110           | VE + AR                               |
| ST Score    | 112           | GS + VE + MK + MC                     |

- This means you need to focus and score well on these topics in specific:
  - GT
    - Verbal Expression (VE)
    - Arithmetic Reasoning (AR)
  - ST
    - General Science (GS)
    - Verbal Expression (VE)
    - Mathematics Knowledge (MK)
    - Mechanical Comprehension (MC)

- 🌐 Utilizing Port 53 (*DNS*) with a VPN on Public Wi-Fi
  - Connect to a VPN service, configuring it to use port 53. This disguises VPN traffic as DNS queries, bypassing login requirements on public WiFi with captive portal networks, ensuring unrestricted internet access while preserving privacy and security.
